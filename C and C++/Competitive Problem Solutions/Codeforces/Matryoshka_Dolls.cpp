// Question Statement
// ====================

// Matryoshka Dolls are Russia's most popular souvenirs. They are sets of wooden figurines of decreasing size placed one inside another, though they have the same exact shape.

// Our Matryoshka Doll is known to have an integer size S which is the largest doll size in the collection, and each doll should have size X times less than the doll that holds it(size of the dollâ‰¤size of the doll that holds itX).

// Given S and X, What is the maximum number of dolls that can be nested inside each other.
